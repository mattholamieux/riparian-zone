### Follow me to the Riparian Zone

This project was built using tone.js & p5.js. It allows users to loop, mangle, & deconstruct tracks from my album Riparian Zone, to create new ambient soundscapes.

It is meant to be explored using a laptop trackpad; it is not mobile-friendly

There are 3 pages of controls, which can be accessed with the number keys 1-3

The 4th page allows you to use the trackpad without affecting any parameters
For best results, use Chrome
